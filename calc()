### Test Cases:

1. **Equivalence Partitioning**:

   - Class 1: Valid inputs (both A and B are integers between 1 and 999)
     - Test Case 1: A = 5, B = 10
     - Test Case 2: A = 500, B = 999
     - Test Case 3: A = 1, B = 1

   - Class 2: Invalid inputs (either A or B is not an integer or not within 1 to 999)
     - Test Case 4: A = 0, B = 1000 (boundary value: A is less than 1)
     - Test Case 5: A = "abc", B = 999 (invalid input: A is a string)
     - Test Case 6: A = 100, B = 1000 (boundary value: B is greater than 999)

2. **Boundary Value Partitioning**:

   - Test Case 7: A = 1, B = 1 (minimum boundary values)
   - Test Case 8: A = 999, B = 999 (maximum boundary values)
   - Test Case 9: A = 500, B = 500 (typical middle values)
